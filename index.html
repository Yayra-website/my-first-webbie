    <h3>My Core Skills</h3>
   <em>There are a few skills that have helped me so far in my journey as a student.
    I believe they will help you too if you adopt them.</em>
</p>
        
<div class="resilience">
<h3 style="text-align:center;">RESILIENCE</h3>
        <hr style="width:200px">
        <p>
            Life is not always smooth and soft.We all know there are some tough moments.
            Life is so full of ups and downs and one thing is certain:You cannot control what life throws at you.The only thing
            that you have full power over is how you react to what life throws at you.It's not easy at all...thats the truth.<br><em><strong>But hey,Resilience is a skill that could be learned.</em></strong>
            Of course,yes some people are naturally able to get over their bitter experiences within the shortest possible time. It is not same for everyone.
            Do not worry.Once it's a skill,it could be learned and mind you,it will follow the same principles it takes to learn any other soft skill:Consistency,Intentionality,Patience and Determination.
         </div>
            <div class="intentionality">
         <h3 style="text-align:center;">INTENTIONALITY</h3>
        <hr style="width:200px">
        <p>
    If at this point of your life,you are not thinking about personal development,please quicken the steps of your thoughts to reach where personal development lies.
    Growth does not just happen. You must be intentional about it.If you want to be the best version of yourself,you dont just sit down and wish for it. If that was it,everyone could have just spoken and they will be whatever they want to be.
    but no,you have to take deliberate steps.The word is de-li-be-ra-te!
        </div>

<h5>NOTE:</h5>
Nobody grows accidentally.You grow by choice and not by chance.I am looking forward to seeing you grow into that person you've always wanted to become.But remember:The choice is yours to make.
        </p>
